# INST706_Group_Project
Hey everyone!

Contained within this Git repository are the files given to us for (at current) Step 2 of our group project:
* the MPP file
* the project description Word file
* the peer evaluation form (just so there's another -- possibly easy -- place to download it).

Hopefully the version control works great, and this will "Git 'er done".
